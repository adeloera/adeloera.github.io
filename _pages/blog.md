You can find my blog posts about economics on <a href="https://andresdeloera.substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a>: 


* <a href="https://andresdeloera.substack.com/p/theres-more-than-one-kind-of-non" target="_blank">There’s more than one kind of “non-rival” and “non-excludable”</a>, in which I argue that economists should teach the types of goods as a three-by-three grid rather than a two-by-two.

* <a href="https://andresdeloera.substack.com/p/can-coase-or-pigou-stop-my-friend" target="_blank"> Can Coase or Pigou stop my friend from smoking?</a>, in which I argue that Coasean bargaining is less effective than conventionally presented in cases with inframarginal units and uncertain counterfactuals.
