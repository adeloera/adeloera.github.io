### About Me

I am a PhD student in economics on the 2025-2026 academic job market. I study environmental and public economics with a focus on the governance of internationally shared ocean resources. I am a NOAA-SeaGrant fellow in Marine Resource Economics and a doctoral student fellow of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program. I have a B.A. in economics from Harvard University.

My job market paper,<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/papers/JMP.pdf">**Climate Change and the Common-Pool Problem in Fisheries**</a>, estimates how fisheries extraction and conservation is affected by the degree of international sharing, and how this will evolve as climate change induces range shifts for many fisheries.
