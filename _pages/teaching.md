## Teaching Philosophy 

Teaching has been one of the highlights of my time in graduate school. I have been the course head of a small seminar class on Natural Resource Economics and the head teaching fellow for a mid-sized lecture course on The Economics of Climate Change and Environmental Policy. In that time I have taught students of various levels and backgrounds and created all kinds of assessments. I am a highly engaged and adaptable instructor, and am particularly excited about creating new courses and content for the era of generative AI. 

## Courses Taught

<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">
<h4><b>Economics 970: Natural Resource Economics<b></h4>

A small seminar class (8-12 students) designed to introduce Economics concentrators to reading and writing economics research. For this class I created a reading list, four quantitative assignments (Stata or R), and six written assignments, including a 15-20 page capstone research paper. I guided students through canonical empirical papers in the field and guided them through the process of writing original research.

<h4><b>Economics 1661/API 135: The Economics of Climate Change and Environmental Policy<b></h4>

A mid-sized lecture class (50-90 students) meant to introduce students to fundamentals of environmental economics. The course is an field course for Economics concentrators, a degree requirement for Environmental Science and Public Policy concentrators, and an elective for masters students at the Kennedy School of Government. I was the Head Teaching fellow for this class, and so was responsible for most course policies, logistics, and assesstments. Teaching fellows also gave weekly review lectures and held office hours.

* “Andres is an incredible instructor. He always returned assignments quickly with thoughtful comments. There were a lot of assignments for the course, but they all felt productive and very relevant to the content. Moreover, he was very encouraging (and helpful) throughout the difficult process of writing the final project. He always replies to emails and the replies are always helpful. He led section discussions very fluently and was great at getting us to participate. If he continues to teach the tutorial, I will 100% be recommending my friends take his tutorial.” –Fall 2022

He does an incredible job leading class discussions — he comes prepared to ever class with an extensive slide deck with questions / figures for discussion, has an extensive understanding of the readings for each class, and does an incredible job synthesizing students' points. He's the most impressive TF that I've had so far at Harvard and a very nice guy as well.” –Fall 2023
* “Andres is very passionate about what he teaches and encourages good class participation. It is very nice to learn the subject matter from someone who really cares and has great experience in the field.
